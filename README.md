## 1.Introduction
## 2.Networking
* The goal of networking is to transefer **Packets**
* **Packets** are stream of bits works as electric signals in physical medium ,this medium may be wire in case of LAN or the air in case of WiFi,carrieng the information to be transefered.<br>
* every packet are devided into **Header and Payload**<be>
* **Header** ensures that the reciver will recive and deal with the data correctly.<br>
* **Payload** is the actual data to be transefered.<br>
### Example - IP protocol header

* The first 4 bits identify the IP version. 
* The 32 bits From 96 represent the source address
* The following Four bits represent the Destination address
### Protocol Layers
1. Application Layer.
2. Transport Layer.
3. Network Layer.
4. Data Link Layer. <br>
**these layers work on top of each other and each layer has its own protocol.**
